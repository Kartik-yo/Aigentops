# AIgentOps: AI Agent Orchestration Platform with Python + Kubernetes

## 🚀 What We Are Building

**AIgentOps** is a fully open-source, Kubernetes-native orchestration layer to deploy, manage, and scale autonomous AI agents across clusters using only Python.

Rather than depending on heavyweight platforms or closed DevOps tools, this system uses:

- ⚙️ Python for the control plane (via FastAPI)
- 📦 Kubernetes for deployment and scaling
- 🧠 Qdrant for vector storage
- 🐘 PostgreSQL for structured data
- ☁️ MinIO for blob storage (S3-compatible)
- 🔐 GitOps-compatible structure with YAML templates

All components are deployed and managed on-prem or in self-hosted environments — **no cloud provider dependency**.

---

## 🎯 Why We Are Building It

As DevOps shifts into the AI era, we believe the next evolution is **AgentOps** — automating and scaling LLM-powered agents like:

- LangChain / AutoGPT workers
- RAG-based knowledge retrievers
- Task-specific bots (support, research, monitoring, etc.)

We aim to solve:

- ✅ Simple & reproducible AI agent deployment
- ✅ Unified management for compute, memory, vector DBs, models
- ✅ Full observability and lifecycle control for each agent
- ✅ On-prem, secure & compliant deployments without vendor lock-in

This project helps infra teams, AI researchers, and edge deployments launch AI workloads reliably — powered by the simplicity of Python and the resilience of Kubernetes.
